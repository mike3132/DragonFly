**What is DragonFly?**

>Dragon-Fly is a plugin that I wrote for the Enhanced Survival server on ResoluteMC. 
>Dragon-Fly is not like any other plugin out there, Most "fly" plugins simply set the players flight mode and allow-flight to true and thus flight is infinite. 
>Dragon-Fly on the other hand keeps the survival feel of the game with adding in a cost to flying.

**Compatibility**
> WorldGuard > https://enginehub.org/worldguard
